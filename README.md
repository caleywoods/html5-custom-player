Day/Lesson #11 from [Wes Bos'](http://wesbos.com/) free [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course where you use vanilla JS

From this lesson so far I have learned JS has vanilla support for Promises.

It was also a good reminder that it's not always best to use arrow functions because of lack of 'this' binding, can cause you to write more verbose code.
