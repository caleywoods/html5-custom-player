Day/Lesson #11 from [Wes Bos'](http://wesbos.com/) free [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course where you use vanilla JS

From this lesson so far I have learned JS has vanilla support for Promises.

It was also a good reminder that it's not always best to use arrow functions because of lack of 'this' binding, can cause you to write more verbose code.

#### TODOS:

* ~~Implement progress tracking and scrubbing, forgot those.~~

* Refactor the query selectors at the top of `scripts.js`, there's probably a way to select just body or `<video>` and query what we want out of that element.

* Convert to function declarations and inline things where possible.

* Reduce binding event listeners to individual elements and combine where it makes sense.
